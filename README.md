## Vision, Description, and Features

Bloo (WIP) is a concept application for curating entertainment media lists and discovering current trending, or new and popular media! It is meant to help avid consumers of shows, movies, or anime, to accurately track their consumption. Curation and sharing are at the forefront of the project! It's also been a passion and practice project for me personally to learn data persistency with CoreData and API usage in a mobile environment.

**NOTE**: This project has been tested to function on iPhone 12 or newer, running at least iOS 16.
